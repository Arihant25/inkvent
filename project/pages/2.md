Look, life is hard. It's a fact. But it's also a fact that you can deal with it. Billions of people have dealt with it before you, and billions more will do after you are gone. So, why not learn from them? Here are some strategies to use when you're faced with any problem in life:

1. **Take a deep breath**: This is the first step to dealing with any problem. It helps you calm down and think clearly. Often in the heat of the moment, we start panicking and hyperventilating and forgetting to breathe. So, take a deep breath and relax.

2. **Take cosmic flight**: Ancient philosophers talked about the concept of cosmic flight. You can do this right now â€” picture yourself slowly lifting up out of your life, above the ground and towards the skies. Keep going higher and higher until you can see the whole planet stretch out below you. Every thing you experienced, every one you know, every problem you have, is just a speck of sand on this tiny blue dot. You are bigger than your problems.

3. **Don't break down, break through**: When faced with a problem, don't let it break you down. Instead, let it break through you. Let it shatter your old self and make way for a new, stronger you. Problems are like a chisel, and you are the marble. They are here to sculpt you into a masterpiece. Embrace them.

4. **Don't ask why, ask how**: Instead of asking why this problem happened to you, ask how you can solve it. This shifts your focus from the past to the present and future. Remember, you are not a victim of your circumstances. You are the master of your destiny. See every problem as an opportunity to prove yourself, to grow, to evolve. You can never know how strong you are until being strong is your only choice.

5. **Don't seek perfection, seek progress**: Life is not about being perfect. It's about making progress. Every step you take, no matter how small, is a step forward. Don't get bogged down by the fear of failure. Embrace it as a part of the journey. No one was ever perfect from the start. They all had to learn, to grow, to evolve. So do you. You will stumble, you will fall, but but you will always get back up, ready to fight another day. That's what humans do. That's what you do.

6. **Don't go it alone**: You are not alone in this journey. There are people who care about you, who love you, who want to help you. Reach out to them. Share your problems, your fears, your doubts. Life is a multiplayer game, whether you like it or not. You can't win it alone. So, don't be afraid to ask for help. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. It takes courage to admit that you can't do it alone. But once you do, you'll find that the world is full of people who are willing to lend you a hand.

7. **Don't give up, give in**: When faced with a problem, don't give up. Give in. Surrender to the flow of life. Accept that you can't control everything. Accept that you can't always win. Accept that you are not perfect. Accept that you are human. And then, let go. Let go of your fears, your doubts, your insecurities. Let go of your need to be right, to be in control, to be perfect. Let go of your ego. Let go of your past. Let go of your future. Let go of everything. And then, just be. Be in the moment. Be in the now. Be in the flow. Be in the universe. Be in yourself.

Remember, life is not a problem to be solved, but a mystery to be lived. Embrace it. Enjoy it. And most importantly, learn from it. Every problem you face is an opportunity to grow, to evolve, to become the best version of yourself. So, don't be afraid of problems. Embrace them. They are your teachers, your guides, your friends. They are here to help you become who you are meant to be. So, face them head on. And remember, you are stronger than you think. You are wiser than you know. You are more powerful than you can imagine. You are a human being. And that's the most amazing thing in the universe.
